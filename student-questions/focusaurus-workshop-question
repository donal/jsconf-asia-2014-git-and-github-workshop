> When an issue needs input from a collaborator, do you @mention them, assign it to them, both, or something else?

That will definitely depend on your workflow. `@mention` is a great mechanism
as long as they have notifications on!

Within GitHub the `@mention`, as part of a question, is used to directly ask
the question of that person. The `/cc @mention` is more like "this might be of
interest to you".

You can read about `@mentions` on the [Mastering Issues
page](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/#notifications).

If I just wanted someone's input, I'd use `@mention`. If I wanted to task them
with work, I'd assign the issue to them.
