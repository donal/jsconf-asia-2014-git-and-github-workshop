> Can you explain github vs gitlab?

GitLab is an alternative to GitHub. On the surface there's a lot of
similarities between the two products, however GitHub (and GitHub Enterprise)
is backed by an incredibly strong engineering, development and UX team that
ensures GitHub provides a great user experience (keep your developers happy!)
and great performance.
